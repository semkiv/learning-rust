// Only "object-safe" traits can be used as trait objects.
// Basically the requirements boil down to the following two:
//     * the return type isnâ€™t `Self`,
//     * there are no generic type parameters.
// This is somewhat analogous to C++ where cannot have virtual template functions (the second requirement) and if you return `*this` by value in a parent class you'll get the object of the child classes returned sliced (Rust simply disallows this by the first requirement)
